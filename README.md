Dear Sriram,

Thank you for your feedback and for being our shepherd. We would like to address the following points for the camera ready.

1. Better explanation of how eVFS is general and is capable of supporting different file system with vastly different format and unique features.
2. Showing generality through implementing eVFS for Btrfs as well, and evaluating them for the conversion tool.
3. Add related work suggested by reviewers.
4. Better discussion of transactional support and feasibility of online implementation.

If you have any other suggestions or comments please let us know. Thanks again.
