@article{Ganger00,
  abstract =     {Structural changes, such as le creation and block allocation,
                  have consistently been identi ed as a source ofproblems
                  (performance, integrity, security and availability) for le
                  systems. This report describes soft updates, an implementation
                  technique that allows a le system to safely use delayed writes
                  for metadata updates. We show that a le system using soft
                  updates asymp-totically approaches memory-based le system
                  performance while providing stronger integrity and security
                  guarantees than most UNIX le systems. For metadata update
                  intensive benchmarks, this improves performance bymore than a
                  factor of two when compared to the conventional synchronous
                  write approach. In addition, soft updates can improve le
                  system availability by relegating crash-recovery assistance
                  (e.g., the fsck utility) to an optional and/or background
                  role, reducing le system recovery time to a few seconds. 1},

  abstract =     {Parallax is a distributed storage system that uses
                  virtualization to provide storage facilities specifically for
                  virtual environments. The system employs a novel architecture
                  in which storage features that have traditionally been
                  implemented directly on high-end storage arrays and switches
                  are relocated into a federation of storage VMs, sharing the
                  same physical hosts as the VMs that they serve. This
                  architecture retains the single administrative domain and OS
                  agnosticism achieved by array- and switch-based approaches,
                  while lowering the bar on hardware requirements and
                  facilitating the development of new features. Parallax offers
                  a comprehensive set of storage features including frequent,
                  low-overhead snapshot of virtual disks, the 'gold-mastering'
                  of template images, and the ability to use local disks as a
                  persistent cache to dampen burst demand on networked storage.},
